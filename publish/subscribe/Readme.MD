## Publish/Subscribe an Introduction
In this section, or RabbitMQ we will be learning about delivering a message to multiple consumers. This functionality is called 'publish/subscirbe'.

## This Program
In this program we will have two receivers or consumers and one will be the sender or the producer. One receiver will be getting the message and saving to the disk and the other one will be printing the message to console.
